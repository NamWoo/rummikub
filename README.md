# Rummikub

##Goal

This program minimizes the number of points that a given player is left with at the end of a game of rummikub. It, in turn, helps the player to win the game. Since there is no "emotional" content to this game, this program could essentially play instead of the human.

##Rules

I will not outline all the rules of Rummikub here. This program plays following the official rules of the commercial version of the game under the same name. **The program does not verify the validity of the inputs**.
